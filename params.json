{"name":"Hellovrworld","tagline":"Tutorial to say Hello World to VR through Unity3D / Gear VR","body":"### \"Hello VR World\".\r\nHello VR World is in late Alpha. It is accompaniment to a tutorial of the same name, and is a beginner's Unity tutorial for Gear VR by a novice. Mistakes are expected, welcome feedback. \r\n\r\n### About the Project\r\nOnce you have finished, “Hello VR World” for Gear VR will contain a 3-D, stereoscopic world (which for once is truly what you make of it) and an animated character who waves at the World and says “Hello VR World” when you gaze directly at her.  In addition, you will learn how to create a multiverse of worlds like your first world, simply by gazing and then tapping on the Gear VR touchpad and ex nihilo generating, with apologies to Disney’s Aladdin, “A Whole New World.”  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@RemedialRobotics - Dan Lesser\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
